# Background Changer: Challenges
Complete the following challenges.

## Final message
After all the code in the `changeBackground` function, use an `alert` to display a message to the user saying "Thank you for using the background changer!"

## Orange button
Create a button in HTML that will change the background to orange when clicked. This will require a new JavaScript function. For an added challenge, use CSS to change the background color of the button itself! Try to use Google to figure out how to do that.

## Error message
If the user enters "red", instead of doing nothing, display a message saying "red is not allowed."

## Purple
If the user enters "purple", change the background color to "red" instead. This will require another `else if` beneath the existing one.

## Random color button
Create a button in HTML that, when clicked, will set the background to a random color. This will require a new JavaScript function.

## Background image
Update the background changer so that it also accepts image URLs. When the program asks the user for a color, if they enter "image", it should then ask for an image URL and set the background.

## Multiple colors
Ask the user for multiple colors, and figure out how to randomly choose one of them for the background color.
