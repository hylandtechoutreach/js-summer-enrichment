# Speed Calculator: Challenges
Complete the following challenges.

## Update styles
Update the styles of the webpage. Feel free to replace the image as well!

## Final message
At the end of the `calculateSpeed` function, display a message to the user saying "Thank you for using the speed calculator!"

## Change greeting
Add an exclamation point at the end of the greeting, so instead of saying "Hello {userName}" it says "Hello {userName}!"

## Vehicle
Before asking the user for their distance/time, ask what type of vehicle they used to travel. Then, after displaying their average speed, display which vehicle they used. For example, if they were traveling by bicycle, display "Traveled by bicycle."

## Kilometers
Convert the average speed from miles per hour to kilometers per hour, and display a message to the user with that value. To convert from miles to kilometers, multiply by `1.60934`.

## Minutes
Instead of asking the user for miles, ask them for minutes. Then, convert those minutes to hours by dividing by `60`.

## Other measurements
Think of some additional ways to measure speed, and convert the average speed to those (ex, miles per minute, inches per day, seconds per yard). Display a message for each of the different measurements.
