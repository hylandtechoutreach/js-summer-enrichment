# Spongebob "Sound" board: Individual Exercises
Update the soundboard with some additional quotes and buttons!

###### Resource: Making Buttons
Remember, the steps to add a button for a quote are as follows:
1. Create a new `button` element in the HTML, and give it text to display
1. _Define_ a new **function** in the JS file
    - To _define_ a function, use the `function` keyword, a function name, parentheses, and curly brackets
1. Within the body of the **function**, use an `alert` to display the quote in a message
1. Back in the HTML, set the `onclick` attribute of the button so that it _calls_ the function
    - To _call_ a function, use the function name and open/close parentheses

## More Quotes
Add new buttons for each of the following quotes:

1. "I'll have you know that I stubbed my toe last week and only cried for 20 minutes."

## New Character
Create a new soundboard for a totally different character! Find an image of the character, and make some new buttons that say quotes from that character.
